This project is an interactive Pong game developed using the Pygame library. It features realistic game physics, collision detection, and a user-friendly interface. The game includes event loops that keyboard inputs for precise paddle control, ensuring an optimal user experience.<br />
The main tasks that were done include:

1. Accurate simulation of ball and paddle movements.
2. Strong collision detection for an ideal gameplay experience.
3. Built-in and responsive interface for enhanced user interation
4. Smooth and accurate paddle control through well-implemented event loops and keyboard inputs.
